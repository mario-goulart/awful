Usage:

  #awful [ <options> ] [ <app1> [ <app2> ... ] ]

<options>:

--development-mode
  Run awful in development mode.  When in development mode, the
  web-repl, the session inspector and a special path for reload
  applications are automatically activated.  They get bound to /web-repl,
  /session-inspector and /reload, respectively, and access to them is only
  permited from the local host.  In this mode, error messages and call
  chains are printed to the client.  Running awful with --development-mode
  is not recommended for applications in production.

--privileged-code=<file1>[,<file2> ...]
  Files with code to be run with administrator privileges (e.g., setting
  port < 1024).

--disable-web-repl-fancy-editor
  By default, the web-repl uses the "fancy" editor (Codemirror), with
  JavaScript to perform code highlight and other useful editor features.
  This option disables the "fancy" editor -- the web-repl will then
  provide a simple textarea for editing code.

--ip-address=<ip address>
  Bind the web server to the given IP address.

--port=<port number>
  Make the web server listen to the given port number.
